Both jars contain only black and white beads, and participants are informed that the left jar contains 80% black beads and 20% white beads, and that the right jar contains 20% black beads and 80% white beads. The jar the next bead comes from has a 90% chance of remaining the same as the current jar, and a 10% chance of switching to the opposite jar. This switching probability, or hazard rate, is disclosed to the participant. Their task is to predict the color of the next bead that is drawn and to give a binary confidence judgement on their prediction. Thus, on any trial, their options are: black bead with high confidence, black bead with low confidence, white bead with high confidence, or white bead with low confidence. \n",

    "We estimate the amount of past information subjects use to make decisions and their predictive accuracy using the information-bottleneck method (Tishby et. al. 2000) on behavioral choice data. This method assumes that subjects form an internal model $M$ that uses past observations ($X_{past}$) to predict some future aspect of the task ($X_{future}$). One benefit of this method is that it allows for the quantification of information complexity without requiring specific assumptions or constraints on the model $M$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We compute the mutual information between $X_{past}$ and $M$ as a measure of the amount of information $M$ encodes about $X_{past}$. We call this $I_{past} := I(X_{past}, M)$. We compute the mutual information between $M$ and $X_{future}$ as a measure of the predicive accuracy of $M$. We call this $I_{future} := I(M, X_{future})$. Larger values of $I_{past}$ and $I_{future}$ correspond to models with higher information complexity and higher predictive accuracy, respectively (Filipowicz et. al. 2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "Both $I_{past}$ and $I_{future}$ can be calculated using only the bead response or using the bead response and confidence judgement together. In the first case, we will use bead choices $R$ as proxies for the participant's mental models $M$. In the second, we will use the combined bead choices and confidence judgements $(R, C)$ as proxies for their mental models $M$. This requires the assumptions that responses are veridical representations of subject mental models and that their mental models are stable throughout the period being measured.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we use the history of beads observed by the participant as $X_{past}$. Due to the limits of human working memory, we are likely able to capture a substantial portion of strategies with reasonably limited window sizes into the past. In addition, our hazard rate serves as a temporal filter, so that more distant past observations hold less information about the future. Thus, although an infinite window into the past would yield the most precise $I_{past}$, we can approximate it well with a limited window size and improve the computational feasibility. Using pilot data from six subjects, we can see how $I_{past}$ evolves with increasing window sizes into the past:"
