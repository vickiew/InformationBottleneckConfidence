Pre-registration for the HMM beads task to measure optimality in human inference

- "HMM_Beads_Preregistration.ipynb" is a jupyter notebook with the pre-registered hypotheses and planned analyses

- ./data contains data used for the example analyses

- ./figs contains figures used in the pre-registration document

- "HMM_beads_utils.py" contains helper functions to run the analyses in the pre-registration notebook

- all of the remaining .pkl files are generated by the notebook to help speed up the analyses. The code used to generate the files is found in the pre-registration notebook
